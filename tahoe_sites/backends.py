    """Backend for organization based authentication

    This class is an extension of Django's `AllowAllUserModelBackend`

    This class checks that the user to authenticate belongs to one of the
    organizations in the specified site

    This class extends `AllowAllUserModelBackend` instead of `ModelBackend`
    because users need to be able to authenticate when the `user.is_active` is
    `False`. The reason for this is that Open edX has an email verification
    scheme that uses `User.is_active` in order to prevent user activity until
    the users have verified their email. Effectively, edx-platform LMS user
    authentication state is used to manage authorization state.

    The key problem is that Django's `django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend`
    is called with `not user.is_active` and Ironwood introduced a check to test
    authentication on a not yet authorized user. This breaks Tahoe multisite
    behavior. Extending `AllowAllUsersModelBackend` restores correct behavior.

    `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`
